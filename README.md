## SFVPN ##

This theme integrates elements of Google's Material Design with Wordpress using the [Material CSS framework](http://materializecss.com/). The underlying file structure, bower and gulp support is indebted to Jeremy Englert's excellent [JointsWP](http://www.jointswp.com), although the theme itself does not use any Foundation elements.

Over the next three years (starting Autumn 2017), this theme will evolve through testing with users who are living with dementia to identify - and hopefully resolve - any accessibility issues they may be having when it comes to using day-to-day web technology.
